Welcome to Piccr
================

Piccr is a Flickr style photo upload web application built in 24 hours by
Marcus Crafter and Lachlan Hardy at Railscamp 2.0, in Bacchus Marsh,
Australia, 2007.

Railscamp is a weekend where Rails and related technology aficionados gather
for 2 days of solid hacking, partying, guitar hero and general fun.

The past two events have been in camp sites with no internet access at all,
and this has sparked a bunch of sites to be built, Piccr was created so that
people during the camp could upload any photos they'd like, taken during the
camp, for all to see.

Piccr offers a forms and REST based API for uploading content which others
have also taken advantage of, during Railscamp Lachie Cox built a Cocoa
frontend that would let you submit photos via your Mac's inbuilt iSight at a
touch of a button.

It's a small Rails app, but please feel free to hack it, any patches more
than welcome! Enjoy!
